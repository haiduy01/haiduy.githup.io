# Commands

`!start [on amt = 25m] [off amt = 5m]` defines on and off phase durations and begins the cycle / timer, which loops indefinitely until `!stop`

`!stop` stops the cycle (done for the day style)

`!lunch [amt = 30m]` interrupts cycle, starts amt timer, resumes normal cycle afterward automatically

# Future work

add params for starting amount. defaults to 25 minutes.
